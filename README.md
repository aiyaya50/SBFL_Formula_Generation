# SBFL_Formula_Generation
## Essential Files
1. Gzoltar_compatible_formula_generation.ipynb is a jupyter notebook python file for generating Gzoltar compatible SBFL formulas base on the hybridization of Ajibode et al. (2022) and Idrees et al. (2023).
2. Formulas_readable.txt contains the 22 formulas generated by 1 above in a readable SBFL terms
3. Formulas.txt contains the 22 generated formulas in Gzoltar terms whose adjustment and implementation are in the 'Generated_Formulas' repository
4. fl.py use the scripts in run.sh to export Defects4J buggy versions, gather coverage information and conduct fault localization on the buggy versions
5. result_analysis.py is to conduct FL result analysis usint TOP_N and wasted effort metrics.
<b>Note</b>
It worth noting that list of buggy lines from defects4j is neccessary to run result_analysis.py.
Refer to https://bitbucket.org/rjust/fault-localization-data/src/master/analysis/pipeline-scripts/buggy-lines/  OR delightly regenerate using extract_buggy_lines.py file.

## Steps
1. run the .ipynb file in jupyter to generate the formulas and manually adjust to conform with Gzoltar/java code
     OR use the formulars in the 'adjusted_formulas' repository
2. Set up Gzoltar and alter some files (SLFormulas.java) to incoporate the outcome of #1 above
